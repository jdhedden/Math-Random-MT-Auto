Math-Random-MT-Auto version 4.03.00
===================================

This module provides pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) that are based
on the Mersenne Twister algorithm.  There is a functional interface to a
single, standalone PRNG, and an OO interface (based on the inside-out object
model) for generating multiple PRNG objects.

The PRNGs are self-seeding, automatically acquiring a (19968-bit) random
seed from user-selectable sources.  Seed sources include local random
devices (/dev/random and /dev/urandom), Internet sources (random.org and
HotBits), and Win32 XP system random data.  Users may also provide their
own seed sources.

In addition to integer and floating-point uniformly-distributed random number
deviates, this module implements the following non-uniform deviates as found
in 'Numerical Recipes in C':
    Gaussian (normal)
    Exponential
    Erlang (gamma of integer order)
    Poisson
    Binomial

This module also provides a function/method for shuffling data based on the
Fisher-Yates shuffling algorithm.

This module is thread-safe with respect to its OO interface for Perl v5.7.2
and beyond.  (The standalone PRNG is not thread-safe.)

For Perl compiled to support 64-bit integers, this module will use a 64-bit
version of the Mersenne Twister algorithm, thus providing 64-bit random
integers (and 53-bit random doubles).  (32-bits otherwise.)

The code for this module has been optimized for speed.  Under Windows, it's
more than twice as fast as Math::Random::MT, and under Solaris, it's more than
four times faster.

INSTALLATION

A 'C' compiler is required for building this module.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Optionally, if you have Module::Build (along with ExtUtils::ParseXS and
ExtUtils::CBuilder) installed, you can install this module using:

  perl Build.PL
  perl Build
  perl Build test
  perl Build install

DEPENDENCIES

Requires Perl 5.6.0 or later.

Requires Scalar::Util 1.16 or later (in Scalar-List-Utils module).

To utilize the option of acquiring seed data from Internet sources,
the following module is needed:

  LWP::UserAgent

On Windows XP, to utilize the option of acquiring seed data from
the system's random data source, the following module is needed:

  Win32::API
