Math-Random-MT-Net version 1.00
===============================

This module provides a replacement for Perl's builtin rand() function
that is based on the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator.

It is self-seeding, automatically acquiring a 624-long-int random seed
from random.org the first time rand() is called.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  LWP::UserAgent

To acquire a maximally random seed, a connection to the internet is
required, although the module will function without it.
