Math-Random-MT-Auto version 6.23
================================

This module provides pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) that are based
on the Mersenne Twister algorithm.  There is a functional interface to a
standalone PRNG, and an OO interface (based on the inside-out object model as
implemented by the Object::InsideOut module) for generating multiple PRNG
objects.

The PRNGs are self-seeding, automatically acquiring a (19968-bit) random
seed from user-selectable sources.  Seed sources include local random
devices (/dev/random and /dev/urandom), Internet sources (random.org, HotBits
and RandomNumber.info), and Win32 XP system random data.  Users may also
provide their own seed sources.

In addition to integer and floating-point uniformly-distributed random number
deviates, this module implements the following non-uniform deviates as found
in 'Numerical Recipes in C':
    Gaussian (normal)
    Exponential
    Erlang (gamma of integer order)
    Poisson
    Binomial

This module also provides a function/method for shuffling data based on the
Fisher-Yates shuffling algorithm.

This module is thread-safe and supports object sharing between threads.

For Perl compiled to support 64-bit integers, this module will use a 64-bit
version of the Mersenne Twister algorithm, thus providing 64-bit random
integers (and 53-bit random doubles).  (32-bits otherwise.)

The code for this module has been optimized for speed.  Under Cygwin, it's
2.5 times faster than Math::Random::MT, and under Solaris, it's more than
four times faster.  (Math::Random::MT fails to build under Windows.)

INSTALLATION

A 'C' compiler is required for building this module.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES
