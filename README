Math-Random-MT-Auto version 1.10
================================

This module provides two random number functions (rand32 and a
replacement for Perl's builtin rand) that are based on the Mersenne
Twister pseudorandom number generator (PRNG).

The PRNG is self-seeding, automatically acquiring a 624-long-int
random seed from user-selectable sources when the module is loaded.
The seed source include local random devices (/dev/random and
/dev/urandom), and Internet sources (random.org and HotBits).

This module is 50% faster than Math::Random::MT.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

To utilize the option of acquiring seed data from Internet sources,
the following module is needed:

  LWP::UserAgent
